The geniusly Build

Geniusly is a project a friend of mine @uxbyomon designed, and since i'm refining my react skills, I decided to bring it to life using components

the project contains 6 major components all pieced together in the app.js file. It was built using create react app and tailwind css, and proved to be an easy practice and was put together in about two hours(a bulk of which was spent refrencing tailwind  css docs lol).
